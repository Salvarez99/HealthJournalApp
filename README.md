Instruction to run application:
    <br> - cd to the HealthJournalApp folder
    <br> - then run npm install on the terminal to download npm_modules dependencies
    <br> - afterwards run npx expo start on the terminal and press 'i' for iOS simulator or 'a' for Android emulator in the terminal where the Expo development server is running. 

Note: The log in functionality will only work if the fireBaseConfig method contains the SDK.
You can obtain this by creating a firebase account and a project then navigating to project settings on the firebase console website. If you scroll down you can copy the firebaseConfig() and replace the same method located in firebaseConfig.js

We did not include the SDK in our repository because of data security concerns.

Once these steps are completed you should be able to create an account and log in as normal without encounting any issues.
